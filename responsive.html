                Denmark is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. 
                It is the most populous and politically central 
                constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutionally
                unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of 
                the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean. 
                European Denmark is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, 
                lying southwest of Sweden, south of Norway, and north of Germany. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Spanning a total area of 42,943 km2 (16,580 sq mi), it consists 
                of the peninsula of Jutland and an archipelago of 443 named islands,
                of which the largest are Zealand, Funen and the North Jutlandic Island. 
                Denmark's geography is characterised by flat, arable land, sandy coasts, 
                low elevation, and a temperate climate.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As of 2022, it had a population of 5.87 million (1 November 2021), of which 800,000
                live in the capital 
                and largest city, Copenhagen. Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in 
                the Danish Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. 
                Home rule was established in the Faroe Islands in 1948 and in Greenland
                in 1979; the latter obtained further autonomy in 2009.
